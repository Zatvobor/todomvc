### In a nutshell

The main purpose of this app is to provide a complete example of MAID application
development routine. This app promotes things like:

- [x] React, Redux and Redux-Thunk conveniences.
- [x] compile JS and CSS through `electron-compile`.
- [x] testing through `electron-mocha`. Tests are running in `renderer` process.
- [x] using Fetch API to interface a `safe_launcher` (ships with mocks in specs).
- [ ] communication to `safe_launcher` over dedicated thread.
- [x] application authorizing with confirmation whether the obtained token is still valid.
- [x] store todo list into safe network.
- [ ] package app into a `asar` archive and release as OSX package (PGP signed).

### Installation and usage

You have to go through `npm install`, `npm test` and finally `npm start`. Tada! You did it.

### Wait, seriously?

Yeah. Make sure you have installed a `safe_launcher` (configured with `use-mock-routing` feature). Here is a link to [Quick start](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_launcher#quick-start).
